Hi, I'm Giuseppe. I'm a self learner (i left university). My main field is computer science but i really like math and science in general. I like to study other sciences because it helps me to understand how different problems in different fields are formulated and solved. I'm obsessed with what i do, it's the thing that gets me out of bed. I like problems that are related to philosophical questions on intelligence, existence and counsciousness. My favorite part of solving a problem is the formulation of the problem. I think that a well stated problem is already solved.
